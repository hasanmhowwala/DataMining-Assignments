Assignment 2

I started out with setting up gpt engineer on my system. Being a windows user it was quite difficult to set up gpt engineer in the vs code terminal.

So I took the rather different approach and set up gpt engineer into my powershell using the open api key and it finally started working. 

I created a small and simple arithematic calculator through feeding the prompt. It generated the program for the same in the powershell. The video of the same is attatched in the assignment. 

Then I saved the file and imported the file ito my vs code. Since I was not able to set up gpt engineer in the vs code due to the OPEN API key not being authorised, I imported my code files to vs code. 

I tried running the program created by gpt engineer. It was showing a particular error named, NameError. 

Then I set up co pilot on my vs code so as to feed prompts. I started out with finding the errors in the file. At the end after giving prompts and doing the respective changes. I tried to run the code but there was no output being generated due to some problems on my system .
